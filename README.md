# blind_touch
Interactive multimodal guide prototype that uses audio and tactile modalities to improve the autonomous access to information and experience of visual artworks.
The prototype is composed of a touch-sensitive 2.5D artwork relief model that can be freely explored by touch. 
Users can access localized verbal descriptions and audio by performing touch gestures on the surface while listening to themed background music along.
